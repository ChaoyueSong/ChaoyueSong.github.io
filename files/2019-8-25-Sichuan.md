&emsp;&emsp; At present, there are often demands to process large quantities of test tube samples in the medical, experimental and other scenarios. In order to facilitate the identification, people often label each sample, from traditional handwriting to today's bar code, etc., the evolution of the labeling method had also brought improvements in processing methods. However, all of these methods have the same disadvantage of being unable to quickly locate it for staff access when a target sample is needed. Therefore, we chose the smaller QR code as the label, which can be placed on the top of the tube so that it does not block each other like the way when we used barcode, and it is also easy to scan and identify in large quantities. <br>

&emsp;&emsp; And then we developed an APP on both Android mobile phone and AR device which can decode plenty of QR codes(more than 160) at the same time. This APP was designed in three different parts: Object Detection, Object Tracking and User interface. We used machine learning model(SSD-like) based on TensorFlow Lite and an efficient method based on FFT in Object Detection part, brought the real-time feature(15 frames/s on CPU) and hign recognition rate(157/160) to this APP by modifying the network structure. In addition, we designed an algorithm based on constructing information matrix to accomplish the Object Tracking part, further improved recognition rate(160/160) through multi-frame fusion. <br>
&emsp;&emsp; This is a video which showed the working process of our APP on Android phone and AR device. <br>

&emsp;&emsp; In addition to those you can see in the video, we have made some improvements to the app. As shown in the figure below,  the decoded information can be displayed directly above the QR code which might be more convenient. <br>
